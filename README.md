# coder-forge
A place to forge out code, to smyth out patterns and designs


# About
The `Coder Forge` has two aims:
 1. is to be a place where adults, young and old, can come to learn to trade
 within the software development industry.
 2. is to be a place where adults, yound and old, can meetup and discuss coding
 and design from an Hobby point of view.

These, workshops, or coder forges, are mimicked on the popular 'Coder Dojo' for
kids, with the exception of being for those 17yrs and up. Lessons will be
thought using, predominantly, open source tools and from a DevOp's methodology.

The classes are to be stress free, without any set out curriculum, and they
must also support and work with other open projects in their locality.

# Technologies
Initially I was going to follow the current standard of teaching with `python`
but I think that maybe `JavaScript` based technologies might be more of a fit.
`JavaScript`'s prototype nature means that we can:
 - Create patterns to describe OOP or scripting arhitectures
 - NodeJS for server logic
 - Meteor for client logic
 - d3 for design

As you can see all technologies are open source, so do expect random rants on
the shortcomings of closed source.

# Roadmap
 - setup more forge's
 - build international community
 - colonize mars
 - make cookies
