# About
The `Coder Forge` has two aims:
 1. is to be a place where adults, young and old, can come to learn to trade
 within the software development industry.
 2. is to be a place where adults, yound and old, can meetup and discuss coding
 and design from an hobby point of view.

These, workshops, or coder forges, are mimicked on the popular [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/) for
kids, with the exception of being for those 17yrs and up. Lessons will be
thought using, predominantly, open source tools and from a [DevOp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) methodology.

The classes are to be stress free, without any set out curriculum, and they
must also support and work with other open projects in their locality.

# Technologies
Initially I was going to follow the current standard of teaching with `python`
but I think that maybe `JavaScript` based technologies might be more of a fit.
`JavaScript`'s prototype nature means that we can:
 - Create [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) to describe [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) or [scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) arhitectures
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) for server logic
 - [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for client logic
 - [d3js](http://d3js.org/) for design

As you can see all technologies are open source, so do expect random rants on
the shortcomings of closed source.

# Additional Resources
As well as the technologies we will also be supporting:
 - [MeetUp](http://meetup.com)
 - [ODesk](http://odesk.com)
 - [Gun.io](http://gun.io)
 - [Guru.com](http://guru.com)

# Roadmap
