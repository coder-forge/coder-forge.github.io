<p>The Coder Forge has two aims:</p>

  <div class="well">
    <p>a place where adults, young and old, can come to learn to trade within the software development industry.</p>
    <p>a place where adults, yound and old, can meetup and discuss coding and design from an hobby point of view.</p>
  </div>
<p>
These, workshops, or coder forges, are mimicked on the popular Coder Dojo for kids, with the exception of being for those 17yrs and up. Lessons will be thought using, predominantly, open source tools and from a DevOp methodology.
</p><p>
The classes are to be stress free, without any set out curriculum, and they must also support and work with other open projects in their locality.
