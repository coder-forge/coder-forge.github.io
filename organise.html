<p>Organising a coder forge is a 2 step process</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find a venue</li>
  <li>Advertise the forge</li>
</ol>

<div class="well">
  The coder forge project is released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">creative commons 4.0 license</a>, this means
  that more forges can grow holistically by simply forking the repository. The
  license in use also allows for different forges to take different directions.
