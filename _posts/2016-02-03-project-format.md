### First sitting

Reviewing the first sitting of a coder forge, one thing has become plainly clear,
there are two completely different needs of the coder. One is the need for
pointers to be given out and the other is the need to learn without constriction.
The need to code. For those that were more proficient with programming it must
have been painful, as I seem to have given more to the former rather than the
latter.

I think there is the need for some direction given from a talk on the one
hand but that learning without constriction far out weighs this need. So I'm
proposing 30 minutes of slide show lessons and then 1 hour, or more, of learning
without constriction. Mentored coding.

It would be nice to have some incrementally difficult problems that could be
solved during the hour or so of learning without constriction. The problems
could be rudimentary such as use jquery to make a div background color flicker,
right up to window api's, frameworks modules & patterns.

So for next weeks format I'm proposing 7.30 to 8.00 talk, most probably about
dealing with clients and targeting jobs, then from 8pm to 9pm we code. I'll
think up some problems to be solved during week. This would also make the forge
much more monitor orientated, so help will be needed here as well ;)
