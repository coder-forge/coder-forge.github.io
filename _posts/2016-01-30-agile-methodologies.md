The development of Agile methodologies should be promoted in these coder forges. There are still those that would not agree with some of the agile processes in use today and this view point must be respected. I see agile methodologies as increasing innovation at the cost of production. This loss can normally be counter acted through automation and increased quality, but these mechanical operations wouldn't suit a project like coder forge. Innovation is a key stone of a project such this and therefore the promotion of developing agile based collaborative development and its suite of tools is vital.

Mechanical processes of all methodologies should naturally be discussed as these are vital to the trade - but having a timely planning poker session before each coder forge is just illogical ;)
